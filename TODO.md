# Soleva Unified Docker Architecture Implementation Plan

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Information Gathered:
- **Root Level**: Already has a unified `docker-compose.yml` with all services (postgres, redis, backend, frontend, nginx, certbot)
- **Backend**: Has separate `docker-compose.yml` for development with duplicated services
- **Frontend**: Has its own Dockerfile and nginx.conf for internal routing
- **Nginx**: Currently configured as unified reverse proxy in root level
- **Environment**: Uses `docker.env` for centralized configuration

### Current Issues:
1. **Duplicate Configurations**: Backend has its own docker-compose.yml with overlapping services
2. **Network Inconsistency**: Backend uses different network name (`solevaeg-app-network` vs `soleva_network`)
3. **Environment Fragmentation**: Multiple env files across different locations
4. **Port Conflicts**: Both root and backend expose same ports (5432, 6379, 8000)
5. **SSL Configuration**: Hardcoded domain names need to be environment-driven

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Cleanup and Consolidation
- [ ] Remove duplicate docker-compose.yml from backend directory
- [ ] Consolidate all environment variables into single .env file
- [ ] Update Nginx configuration to be more flexible with domain names
- [ ] Standardize network naming across all services

### Phase 2: Enhanced Unified Configuration
- [ ] Add missing Celery services to main docker-compose.yml
- [ ] Implement proper health checks for all services
- [ ] Add development vs production environment handling
- [ ] Configure proper volume mounts for development

### Phase 3: Nginx Optimization
- [ ] Update Nginx configuration to use environment variables for domains
- [ ] Optimize reverse proxy settings
- [ ] Implement better security headers
- [ ] Add proper CORS handling

### Phase 4: Environment Management
- [ ] Create comprehensive .env.example file
- [ ] Add environment validation
- [ ] Implement proper secrets management
- [ ] Add development/production environment switching

### Phase 5: Documentation and Testing
- [ ] Update deployment documentation
- [ ] Create quick start guide
- [ ] Test unified setup
- [ ] Verify all services communication

## Files to be Modified:
1. `docker-compose.yml` (root) - Enhanced with Celery services
2. `docker.env` - Consolidated environment variables
3. `nginx/conf.d/soleva.conf` - Environment-driven configuration
4. `soleva back end/docker-compose.yml` - Remove (redundant)
5. New `.env.example` - Comprehensive template
6. New `docker-compose.dev.yml` - Development overrides

## Expected Benefits:
- Single command deployment: `docker compose up -d`
- Centralized configuration management
- Reduced complexity and maintenance overhead
- Better development experience
- Improved scalability and monitoring
